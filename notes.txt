What we're doing in this version

Fix diagnol movement so that it doesn't jitter
This is caused by the up and left movements happening asychronously

-------------

Fixed the diagnol hop problem
Still not fully clear WHY this was happening... but it was related to the delta needed
for triggering a cell movement being higher than 1

This means that if you walked left and had a leftwards buffer between 0 and 2, that buffer did not get wiped out.
If you started moving upward and triggered cell movement, both upwards and leftwards movement would occur
This is because you still have a left over leftwards buffer

-------------
We want to add room transitions in this version...

coz why not?!?!??

-------------
