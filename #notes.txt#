What we're doing in this version

Fix diagnol movement so that it doesn't jitter
This is caused by the up and left movements happening asychronously

-------------

Fixed the diagnol hop problem
Still not fully clear WHY this was happening... but it was related to the delta needed
for triggering a cell movement being higher than 1

This means that if you walked left and had a leftwards buffer between 0 and 2, that buffer did not get wiped out.
If you started moving upward and triggered cell movement, both upwards and leftwards movement would occur
This is because you still have a left over leftwards buffer

-------------
We want to add room transitions in this version...

coz why not?!?!??

-------------

Create the 3 Controllers...

Controller
GridController
MapController

Fay being trapped problem
Aka The Cask of Amontillado bug

Before Fay can move to a new grid square, the engine needs to check to make sure that square is open
Once the engine confirms the square is open, Fays position can update
Certain sets of movements cause Fay to be able to glitch into a new square even though the check for openness on that square failed
In particular, when Fay switches screens, theres no checking for collisions in Fays next square
We can address this problem by adding a bunch of stupid bullshit to precheck rooms that aren't even loaded yet for collisions
But for now, lets add a safeguard so that in ANY circumstance, where Fay glitches herself inside  a wall, we can move Fay back into valid play space
The first thing we need to do is check if Fay is inside a wall
The problem is, even if Fay is surrounded on all sides by wall tiles, we STILL dont know for sure if she is legitimately trapped in a wall, or if the game has just place her in a 1x1 room space
So for now, I'll write a check that determines if Fay is surrounded by all sides by wall tiles
BUT Fay is going to have to have a boolean variable that determines if she is or isnt being intentionally place in a 1x1 room to distinguish between the 2 cases

So check will go like this
For NSEW
Is this side of Fay blocked by a wall?
Is this side of Fay out of bounds of the grid?
If all of these are true, then Fay is trapped
Print to the log that Fay is trapped
Move Fay to the center of her current room

^^^^ A kludge solution, but I'm anticipating that this won't be a frequent circumstance
